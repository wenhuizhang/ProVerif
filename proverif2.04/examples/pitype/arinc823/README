Analysis of the ARINC823 protocols.

This directory contains all models used to verify the ARINC823
protocols in ProVerif.

- gen is a script that analyzes all files.
- results is a summary of the results provided by this analysis.

1. Directory "sharedkey": the shared-key protocol

arinc823-secret-key.m4.pv is the master file from which all models 
are generated using the m4 preprocessor. The generated files are
arinc823-secret-key.$p.$e.$s.pv where
        $p is the property
	   - AUTHENTICATION for authentication properties
	   - KEY_SECRECY for secrecy of keys 
	   - SECRECY for secrecy of messages 
	   - UKS for no unknown key share attacks
        $e is
	   - ENC_SUPPORTED when the aircraft supports encryption
	   - ENC_NOTSUPPORTED when it does not
        $s is 
	   - FAST when the equations encode(encode_OFF,x) = x
	   and compress(comp_OFF,x) = x are omitted.
	   - SLOW when they are included. (These scripts are so slow
	   that not all of them terminated within a reasonable amount of time.)

2. Directory "publickey": the public-key protocol

arinc823-public-key.m4.pv is the master file from which all models 
are generated using the m4 preprocessor. The generated files are
arinc823-public-key.$p.$c.$e.$s.pv where
        $p is the property
	   - AUTHENTICATION for authentication properties (including
	   no unknown key share attacks)
	   - KEY_SECRECY for secrecy of keys 
	   - SECRECY for secrecy of messages
	$c determines the compromise scenario 
	   - PFS for forward secrecy (all long-term keys compromised after
	   the end of the protocol)
	   - COMPROMISE_U for key compromise impersonation in which U is
	   compromised.
	   - COMPROMISE_V for key compromise impersonation in which V is
	   compromised.
        $e is
	   - ENC_SUPPORTED when the aircraft supports encryption
	   - ENC_NOTSUPPORTED when it does not
        $s is 
	   - FAST when the equations encode(encode_OFF,x) = x
	   and compress(comp_OFF,x) = x are omitted.
	   - SLOW when they are included. (These scripts are so slow
	   that not all of them terminated within a reasonable amount of time.)
